## Games
### Game Types
Games will suport custom games wherein the dealer determines how many decks, how many cards per player, any open cards, betting structure (teen patti or poker), wild cards, etc.
* Predefined Games
* Custom Games
### Betting and Stakes
Betting will support teen patti style betting with 'seen' bets being double of 'blind' bets. The user will be allowed to set the minimum bets - the structure will be dependent on the game. So for example, for teen patti - we need to specify the maximum number of blind rounds.  And the fact that seen requires double the bet. So for teen patti - the system and the game players will know when the user has seen his cards.
