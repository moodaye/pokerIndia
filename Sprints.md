  1/27/2021: Was able to do this successfully - pretty much following the tutorial.  Some things to consider / remember:
  The executable jar file i created was using java 11 compiler.  The version i installed on ec2 was java 8.  The error message said that the jar had been compiled to class version 54.  I looked up this - java 8 compiles to class version 52.  I needed java 11.   Used yum to install and "alternatives --config java" to select java 11.
  (This task completed - all tasks completed for this sprint).
